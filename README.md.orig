# Project Euler Portfolio

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to view my Project Euler solutions!

This repository is a record of my work on the Project Euler challenges from https://projecteuler.net

I will be attempting to solve the first 100 problems using each programming language I know as a way to review my skills, practice, and prove my knowledge by doing something other than watching/reading "how to program" tutorials. 

Planned languages:
- Java
- C++
- Python
- JavaScript
- C
- C#
- Ruby

Problems currently solved:
